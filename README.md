ðŸš¦ *Revolutionizing Traffic Management with AI! ðŸš—*  

Excited to share my latest project â€“ *Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) System*! ðŸŽ‰  

This system leverages *Computer Vision, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and AI* to detect and recognize vehicle license plates in real time. It automates traffic violation alerts, retrieves vehicle owner details from a database.  

### ðŸ”§ *Key Features*  
âœ… *Real-time License Plate Detection* using OpenCV & Haar Cascade  
âœ… *OCR-based Text Extraction* for accurate recognition  
âœ… *Database Lookup* to fetch owner details    
âœ… *Dynamic Fine Calculation* & location-based violation tracking  
âœ… *Interactive UI* built with Streamlit  

This system enhances *traffic management* by ensuring *efficient violation tracking, automated fine collection, and safer roads*. ðŸš¦  

ðŸ’¡ *Tech Stack*: Python | OpenCV | Tesseract OCR | Streamlit | SQLite
