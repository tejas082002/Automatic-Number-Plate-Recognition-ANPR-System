# Automatic-Number-Plate-Recognition-ANPR-System
🚦 *Revolutionizing Traffic Management with AI! 🚗*  

Excited to share my latest project – *Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) System*! 🎉  

This system leverages *Computer Vision, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and AI* to detect and recognize vehicle license plates in real time. It automates traffic violation alerts, retrieves vehicle owner details from a database, and even sends *WhatsApp notifications* for fines.  

### 🔧 *Key Features*  
✅ *Real-time License Plate Detection* using OpenCV & Haar Cascade  
✅ *OCR-based Text Extraction* for accurate recognition  
✅ *Database Lookup* to fetch owner details  
✅ *Automated WhatsApp Alerts* for traffic violations & fine notices  
✅ *Dynamic Fine Calculation* & location-based violation tracking  
✅ *Interactive UI* built with Streamlit  

This system enhances *traffic management* by ensuring *efficient violation tracking, automated fine collection, and safer roads*. 🚦  

💡 *Tech Stack*: Python | OpenCV | Tesseract OCR | Streamlit | SQLite | PyWhatKit
